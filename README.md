# My Personal Website

There's not much to say.
It's written in Svelte and I try to update this regularly.

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm setup
npm run dev
```

can also use ``npm watch`` instead of ``npm setup`` to continually update the css.

## Deployment

```bash
npm run build
```

Then copy the build folder to github pages (should write a script for this).
